Welcome to Ryan Geary's Znedesk Ticket Viewer API implementation!

My code was written in Python and Windows Batch Scripting!

My implementation also requires that you have a Token API. If you are on the Zendesk Recruitment Team, I have sent it in the email along with this repository.

For it to work, type the token, and only that token, in the token.txt file in this directory. Then you should be all set to go!

To run this program, you can download my code and use the command:

python main.py

while in the folder of the program.

My implementation requires Python 3.xx to be installed, as well as curl.exe to be able to be run from the command line.

Chances are, curl.exe is on your computer if you have a Windows 10 computer and you update it semi-often.

If not, check out this super helpful Stack Overflow post on it!

From there, my program is fairly self-explanatory in the GUI.
